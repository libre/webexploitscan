<p>The key is to answer your questions about WES and these features. This small built-in FAQ solves installation, scan or other problems.</p>				  
<dl class="accordion">
<dt><a href="">Why are there more files than scanned files?</a></dt>
<dd>WES specializes in the protection of websites and web applications. It is not designed to scan binary data like photos, videos, sounds .. That\'s why you will find that there are more files than those scanned ... Except exploits security of your browser, a site is difficult to access from a binary diretement. It must imperatively injected malignant code and into one or more text files and that is exactly what track WES!</dd>
<dt><a href="">WES | Webexploitscan is free?</a></dt>
<dd>Yes, the Communauty version is free because we think we can offer a useful tool to the community.
That being the case, like many, you have to evolve it, allow it to go further. 
That\'s why we offer several types of licenses at your disposal.

<dt><a href="">Why is there so little signature in parallel with the classic antivirus? </a></dt>
<dd>In reality, unlike the binary virus that contaminates your computer or phone, malicious code in a website is usually offsets by different methods. These methods are known and it is easier to detect a virus on a web space than on your computer. It is not necessary to know the malic code to know that it is nuable.</dd>
<dt><a href="">It seems that it is blocked and that it is indicated that another process is under way? </a></dt>
<dd>It can happen that some latency of the query creates a problem. Assured that no scan is running, delete the lock file, queue and the .lst file and the rules.lst file. After you can restart a scan.</dd>
<dt><a href="">WES Scanning you in the database? </a></dt>
<dd>No, but it\'s planned in the roadmap, encouraged us! The object is indeed to be able to scanned the contents of the database in order to find the resident rogue scripts in XSS for example.</dd>
<dt><a href="">WES is GDPR / RGPD Compliance? </a></dt>
<dd>Yes, we harvest in a way to announce the usage statistics and the different result scan metrics. The object is obviously to be able to improve the tools and these performances. No other data is collected or transmitted. WES is above all a protection tool!</dd>
<dt><a href="">Does WES detect me from my Wordpress? </a></dt>
<dd>No, we only check if you have the latest version of Wordpress. WES is a tool for protecting, disinfecting your web space and whatever CMS tools you use.</dd>
<dt><a href="">WES works on Linux and Windows?</a></dt>
<dd>Yes perfectly, WES | Webexploitscan 3.0 has been designed to work on both Linux and Windows. He does not subscribe to any additional libraries. In addition, WES is dedicated to being fully compatible on traditional hosting platforms of known operators. (OVH, GoDaddy, Kudo, ...)</dd>
<dt><a href="">Why WES is not available directly by a CMS module like Wordpress?</a></dt>
<dd>Webexploitscan is a stand-alone tool independent of different CMS. It is as compatible as possible and neeseciste no configuration on the side of your tools. This method allows for example to decontaminate your compromised Wordpress without having this connected to the backend (if still possible).</dd>
