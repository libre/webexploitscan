# Contribution : 

If you have additional test to include, please send me a message, I'd be happy to add it. If you encounter a bug, your report will be of great help.
Finally, I work on a version of real-time scanning in order to provide protection even before your server is exploited. Here there is a script to detect and decontaminate your server.
