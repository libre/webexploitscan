# Webexploitscan
Webexploitscan can scan your web space to locate the majority of shells PHP, Java or SSI. It is designed to identify and detect the web shell which hide it on your server. malicious code or encrypted shell. 

This is my first Github project, it currently includes 25 different tests and can identify most shells it encrypted or not. (It detects encryption methods or PHP code obfuscation, some in Java and some type of SSI injection).

# Contribution : 

If you have additional test to include, please send me a message, I'd be happy to add it. If you encounter a bug, your report will be of great help.

Finally, I work on a version of real-time scanning in order to provide protection even before your server is exploited. Here there is a script to detect and decontaminate your server.
